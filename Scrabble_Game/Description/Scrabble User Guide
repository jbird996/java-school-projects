The first step to beginning play is to register all players who intend to play.

To properly register you must enter your name and then hit the register button.

Once all players have registered you may hit the start button to begin play.

The order of play will be randomly determined when the game begins. From that point forward the 
order will be set.

When it is the player's turn they may place and retract tiles from their tilerack in order to form 
a word.

On the first turn of play the first word placed must have at least one tile placed over the homesquare, 
which is designated on the board by a "*".

After that word is placed any word may be placed o long as it connects to a previously placed word and 
is a valid word.

The validity of a word is determined by the following definitions:

- Words may only be placed with their start to end flowing from either top to bottom or left to right.
- A word will only be valid so long as it matches a word contained within the game's dictionary.

When a player is satisfied with their placements or wishes to skip their turn, they may hit the 
"end turn button" to continue onto the next player.

Play may continue so long as any player possesses tiles that they may play. 

If players only still possesses tiles that they cannot make a valid word with, or if they wish to end 
the game early, they may click the "end game" button.

Clicking the end game button will end play and display the endgame screen where players may view their 
score and restart the game.
