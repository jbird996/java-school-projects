**FileScanner class provided by University Faculty to ease data extraction from provided files**


This project is a matching game that was assigned during first semester java programming.  We were
provided files containing pictures, names, and descriptions of our UTA's and some various faculty
members.  The goal was to create a matching game using these pieces of data.  

First the files are scanned and data as allocated appropriately.  Next the data is rendered via a
GUI and randomized.  To play, you must run the project, and select a picture, name and description.  
If the data matches the an individual, the selected items are removed from the GUI.  This process 
continues until the last match is removed and the program is terminated.
